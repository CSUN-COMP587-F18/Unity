Nothing to see or review here in terms of code, this is just a progress update as I recently resubmitted my project proposal.
I'm doing whatever I can to get property testing working in this project, 
but it's apparently hilariously outdated in its framework which means its incompatiable with fscheck (the property testing tool), 
and attempting to change this framework winds up wrecking the whole thing. 
Will continue to attempt sorting out this nightmare over the next week.
